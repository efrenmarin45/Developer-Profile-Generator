# Github Developer Profile Generator

## Purpose
This project was meant to work more with the Github API to be able to dynamically produce an HTML page with the users Github stats. From there, the program would then be able to convert to a PDF file. This would be done through Javascript, CSS, and Node.JS. 

## Project Status
Still working on being able to use module.exports and finding a way to properly display the information dynamically as a new file. I will be having a small hiatus on this while I research some more and try to pin down where the disconnect is. This project is considered to be a Work in Progress. Since this is still an incomplete project in my eyes, there are no screenshots or links to a live view except for a snippet of the terminal shown below.
